# June 4th: Made a simple but complete PCB design.

I used KiCad and created a schematic similar to what was taught in acon's Solder workshop.
Because I'm making my own PCB for the first time, it took a lot of trial and error to figure out how everything worked. Assigning footprints and migrating from the Schematic Editor to the PCB Editor was tricky, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.
I wired my components, as well as decorated the front side with silkscreen text.
